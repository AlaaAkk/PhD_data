 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable

  Defaulting to use time-reversal symmetry for k-point grid.
  Charge integration errors on the 3D integration grid will be compensated

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.42010817 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99990701
  | K-point:      20 at    0.125000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.36656227 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00024797
  | K-point:       2 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.250000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.05354589 eV between HOMO at k-point 20 and LUMO at k-point 2
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.39512398 eV for k_point 70 at    0.375000    0.125000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, the gap value is rather small. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is most likely metallic (in the sense that there are states
  at or near the Fermi level). A DOS and/or band structure plot is required
  for an unambiguous distinction.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.50635827 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99714221
  | K-point:      12 at    0.000000    0.375000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.46665146 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00846950
  | K-point:       2 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.250000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.03970681 eV between HOMO at k-point 12 and LUMO at k-point 2
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.39510746 eV for k_point 70 at    0.375000    0.125000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, the gap value is rather small. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is most likely metallic (in the sense that there are states
  at or near the Fermi level). A DOS and/or band structure plot is required
  for an unambiguous distinction.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.04645434 eV between HOMO at k-point 37 and LUMO at k-point 2

  However, the gap value is rather small. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is most likely metallic (in the sense that there are states

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :        -222473.348568306 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :        -222473.348568746 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -33.689816645 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
